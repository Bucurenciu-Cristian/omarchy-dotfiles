# /find-missing-tests - Test Coverage Audit

You are a senior developer. Your job is to review this code and write out a list of missing test cases and code tests that should exist.

Be specific. Do not hallucinate.

Think quietly to yourself, then act - write the issues. The issues will be given to a developer to execute on, so they should be in a format compatible with GitHub issues.

For each missing test, create a corresponding issue in GitHub.
